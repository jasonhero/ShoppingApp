# Shopping Mate

Requirements:
- Install expo (https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/get-started/installation/)

### How to run

Step 1:

`$ npm install`

Step 2:

`$ npm run start`

Step 3:

Open in iOS/Android simulator or on phone through expo.


### Notes

Once you load the app you'll be presented with a product splash screen, from there you'll be able to: "Favorite" products with the heart icon, click into products for more detail, filter products by brand, and view only products that you have favorited.

Prices/ratings are fixed, since price data was not available in the API ("price level"? was however).
